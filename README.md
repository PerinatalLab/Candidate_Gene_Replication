# Replication and TWAS of candidate genes of gestational duration

While many efforts have been put into the exploration of the genetic basis of gestational duration, only one GWAS conducted to date has been capable of discovering and replicating several loci associated with gestational age.  
Here, we propose a candidate gene study, in which genes previously investigated are re-evaluated on different phenotypes (gestational age, PTD, PROM, post-term), different study designs (case-control and cohort), and different ancestries (European, African-American).
